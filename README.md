# Heart_Beat_Sound_Analysis

OBJECTIVE Heart Beat Sound Analysis - • It is a task • Use sound as input • Process the sound(feature extraction , feature selection) • Model the speech(using AI) • recognizing the heart problem

TECHNOLOGY USED Computer-Lenovo ideapad 310 Software- Python 3.9 DataSet-Heartbeat Sounds(Classifying heartbeat anomalies from stethoscope audio)

FEATURE(MFCC)(Used by librosa Python library) A subset of features that are used for  Heart Beat Sound Analysis is grouped under a category called the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) . It can be explained as follows: • The word Mel represents the scale used in Frequency vs Pitch measurement . The value measured in frequency scale can be converted into Mel scale using the formula m = 2595 log10 (1 + (f/700)) • The word Cepstrum represents the Fourier Transform of the log spectrum of the speech signal.

Machine learning Algorithm(Used by sklearn Python library))-

Machine learning is- • a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science • focuses on the use of data and algorithms • It is imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

ALGORITHM USED 1)Linear_SVM
2)Gradient_Boosting
3)Decision_Tree
4)Random_Forest
5)Naive_Bayes



MAX ACCURACY Linear_SVM 70.94017094017094%,Gradient_Boosting- 72.64957264957265%,Decision_Tree-69.23076923076923%,Random_Forest 79.48717948717948%, Naive_Bayes- 77.77777777777778%
RESULT- 

Random_Forest( 79.48717948717948%) as best Machine learning algorithm for this problem. My opinion is that this algorithms is suitable for this type of problem.

Thank you.
